# derock.blog

A simple blog website built using `Solid-Start` and `Tailwind`.  
Uses a [Notion](https://notion.site/) database as the CMS.

If deployed to Vercel (recommended), the site will use [Vercel Prerendering](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3#vercel-primitives/prerender-functions) as a form of ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration).
Otherwise you will have to figure out caching on your own.
